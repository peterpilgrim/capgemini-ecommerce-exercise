# capgemini-ecommerce-exercise

This was my project to answer the [Cap Gemini](https://www.uk.capgemini.com/] E-Commerce Challenge 2017 
 
This challenge was my answer to test.


 1. Shopping Cart
    
    * You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges
    * Apples cost 60p and oranges 25p
    * Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till outputs the total cost
    * For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
    
 2. Simple offers
 
    * The shp decides to introduce two new offers:
        * buy one, get one free on Apples
        * 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
    * Update your checkout functions accordingly.
    

I used Scala 2.12 and the ScalaTest 3 release
